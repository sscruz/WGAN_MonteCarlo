# MC simulations with WGAN 

Code to generate MC simulations with WGANs. It includes examples to train a generating network using the MNIST dataset and generator-level Drell--Yan Monte Carlo simulations.

## Set up the environment 

The `environment.yml` file contains the packages needed to run the code with pytorch and CUDA 10.2. 

```
conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate pytorch_v1_cuda_10_2

```

## Examples with different datasets

### Generate images using the MNIST dataset

`python wgan.py --generator_iters 40000  --model convNNforNist --data mnist --trainingLabel mnisttraining  --do_what train --do_what generate`

### Generate Drell-Yan events using gen-level MC

`python wgan.py --generator_iters 100000  --model dense6inputs --data dygen --trainingLabel dytraining --do_what train --do_what generate`


## Package contents

- `wgan.py`: main script that contains the training algorithm and the parsing of the different options.

- `models` directory: contains different architectures for the generator and critic networks, that is selected with the `--model` option. Associated to the critic is the dimensionality and distribution of the latent space, which is also defined here. 

- `data` directory: contains the scripts to handle data. It contains two example classes `drellyan_gen` and `mnist`, that are imported through `data_loaders`. In the context of this repository, data handling includes fetching the data, its preprocessing and its postprocessing, including production of plots.
